    description: 'In 2014, a pair of friends launched this little Left Bank bar, which features organic products by small producers. It’s not a big-name affair, but you should expect a smattering of tourists among the smiling locals gathered here. A warm welcome, good food, and good wine are all that it takes -- and it’s located right near the Pont Neuf, so you won’t have to go hunting',

It offers over 170 wines, and most come directly from their producers. It has all the trappings of a solid wine bar, with honey-roasted camembert, Spanish ham, and foie gras. Tiny, quaint, sometimes rowdy, but always a good bet, it’s just far enough away from the touristy parts of Montmartre to still be appropriately cool',

It is unabashedly French when it comes to wine, so don’t expect more exotic quaffs. It’s not really a scene as far as entertainment is concerned, but for a calmer glass and some nibbles, you can’t really beat it. Great for when grandma’s in town',
