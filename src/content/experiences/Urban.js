    address: '29 Rue de la Butte aux Cailles, 75013 Paris',
    opened: 'Every Sunday at 1pm (2.5 hours approx)',
    description: 'Explore Paris’ new mural district, the 13th Arrondissement on Paris’ Left Bank, and see large-scale street art and smaller unsanctioned works by French and international artists.'
    + 'The 13th is unlike other Parisian districts.The Parisian East, the cradle of the French revolutions (1789, 1830, 1848, 1870), and traditionally the richest territory for fans of the urban arts to explore. However, whereas the classic Hausmannian architecture that predominates in Paris dating from the 19th Century is mostly off-limits to being painted, the 13th arrondissement comprises of unspectacular high-rise apartment buildings, with a lower valeur historique. Unlike in other Parisian neighbourhoods, the local townhall has been commissioning artists to go ‘big’ on these big ugly tower blocks. The propagation of these works is largely thanks to support by the local mayor, contemporary art enthusiast Jérôme Coumet and his team. For the biggest of these works, a vote is put out to local residents who get to have a say on what gets painted.  This favourable attitude to graffiti-street art has also left the door open for organised events such as La Tour Paris 13 in which over one hundred French and international street artists occupied a tower block marked for destruction – one of the largest ever ephemeral art exhibitions.',

    opened: 'Every first Sunday of each month at 10am (2.5 hours approx.)',
    description: 'The Street Art Paris graffiti mural workshop is taught by real, yes, real, Parisian graffiti artists. You’ll pick up the basic techniques of how to spray a can and design basic typography, but mainly, to conceive and then paint a large-scale graffiti mural as a group.'
    + 'How it works is that after getting over the novelty factor of using spraypaints [one minute spent writing name, etc] everyone works with pencil and paper to brainstorm ideas, which are gathered to form an overall concept and design. Depending on the overall artistic level of the group [generally very, very low – you work behind a computer all day long, it’s ok, we understand], we make our design onto the wall with your help, or create shapes for you to paint with pretty colours, while we go round the edges making you feel like you made it all by yourself. Either way, you come away feeling great [one 2.5 hour class gives results equal to an extended , and far more expensive, course with Irvin Yalom], and with new skills to share with your way less cool friends and family [the ones who weren’t with you – obvs]',

    description: 'The Catacombs are underground ossuaries in Paris, which hold the remains of over six million people in a small part of the ancient Mines of Paris tunnel network. The ossuary was founded when city officials were faced with two simultaneous problems: a series of cave-ins starting in 1774 and overflowing cemeteries. Nightly processions of bones from 1786 to 1788 transferred remains from cemeteries to the reinforced tunnels, and more remains were added in later years.  The catacombs are formally known as l\'Ossuaire Municipal or Catacombes officiels and have been called The World\'s Largest Grave due the number of individuals buried.',
